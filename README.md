Hello world!

My name is Eileen LaBrutto! I hope you're doing well!

Welcome to my repository! Here I'll post my data science projects completed during my MS program. I want to use this platform as a means to showcase my skills, share my projects, and showcase what I've learned as a student and what I can translate into a professional career as a data scientist!
